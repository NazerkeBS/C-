# C++ problem solutions 

- Create a function which returns a random choice of head or tail.
- Get a guess from the user and print if he/she has managed to hit the random
  generated choice.
- Generate 1000 random choices. Determine the ratio of heads.
- How many times was "heads" chosen exactly twice after each other? For
  example: THHHHTTHHTHHHTHH -> 2
- How long was the longest sequence of heads?



The lottery.txt file contains the lottery results back to 1957.  The first line
of the file contains a number which gives the number of further lines. Each
line contains the numbers of a week in ascending order. The following tasks
have to be solved based on this input file:
- Read 5 numbers from the user, all of them should be between 1 and 90. Check
  if all numbers are from this interval.
- Print these numbers in ascending order.
- Determine based on the input file which number was pulled most times.
- Create a function which requires two vectors of length 5. The function should
  return how many elements of the two vectors match.
- Based on the input file let's determine how many times the user has 1, 2, 3,
  4 or 5 matches if he or she played every week.
